About the original release order:

- The "Ace Attorney Investigations" spin-offs were released right after "Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney", although playing them in this order is seldom recommended nowadays.

- The "Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright" crossover came out right after the AAI spin-offs. Some might recomend playing it at any point after the "Phoenix Wright Trilogy" (Games 1-3).

- "PW: AA - Spirit of Justice" was released in-between both games in "The Great Ace Attorney" duology. It is not recommended to play them like this at all.
