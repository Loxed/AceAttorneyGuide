About this site
===============

The purpose of this site/guide is to create deeplinks to different guides and resources for the Ace Attorney series, such as the ones on Strategy Wiki. The guides provided by Strategy Wiki are fantastic, however, navigating to specific pages to progress in the games can be a time-consuming process. This site aims to simplify the navigation process by directly linking to the relevant content, making them quickly accessible.

This site was made using mdbook, a tool for creating books with Markdown. The public repository of the site is available [here](https://github.com/Loxed/AceAttorneyGuide) (if anyone wants to fork/contribute).

Note: I mainly made this site for personal fast-access to resources I find useful. However, I hope that others will also find it helpful and contribute to its development if they wish to.
